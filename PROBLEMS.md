1. **Basic Microservice Deployment Using Docker and Spring Boot**
  - **Problem Statement**: A small e-commerce company wants to create a simple microservice-based application using Spring Boot.
    Each microservice (e.g., product, inventory, order) needs to run independently without interfering with each other.
  - **Solution**: Containerize each Spring Boot microservice using Docker and create isolated environments for each service.
    Practice building Docker images for individual services, managing dependencies, and running each service in a separate container.
  - **Key Docker Concepts**: Building Docker images, managing environment variables, container networking.
